## Why should you listen to me

<v-clicks>

- I've been using NixOS for more than a year

- I've read the PhD thesis documenting the inner workings of Nix titled: "The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model"

- I've wrote a poem for NixOS (available for reading at the end of the slides)

   So yeah I'm **VERY** interested in Nix and NixOS

# The How

<div class="grid grid-cols-[70%_30%] gap-8 h-full items-center">

<div class="flex flex-col justify-center">
  The creation of Nix started in 2003 by Eelco Dolstra as an academic research project. The foundational concepts were introduced to the world in 2004 through the paper "Nix: A Safe and Policy-Free System for Software Deployment" which laid out its revolutionary purely functional model. This theoretical foundation was then expanded into a comprehensive framework in Dolstra's 2006 PhD dissertation, "The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model." From these robust academic roots, the project grew steadily in the open-source world, reaching its stable 1.0 release in 2012.
